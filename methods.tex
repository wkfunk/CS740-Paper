\section{Methods}
The approach we have decided to take for the project is system-building.
Our task is to devise an internet payment architecture which fulfills our guidelines of scalability and maximizing usability.
One of the major difficulties in this task is addressing the shortcomings of the attempts we've outlined above.

Specifically, our plan is to explore a framework similar to that of Google Contributor, so we will primarily need to address the concerns of overhead and ad coverage.
Any overhead required by our system will limit its scalability, preventing widespread adoption from ever being an option.
Similarly, if our system is not able to extend to all forms of digital advertising, ad-blocking users who are used to entirely ad-free viewing will not be attracted to using it.
Hence, we must find a way to replace all advertisements (those from premium campaigns, ad networks, and ad exchanges), rather than only those from one source.

There are also some practical questions which are left to be answered, such as the feasibility of entering the advertising industry from a business standpoint, but we will consider those outside the scope of the project; our focus lies in design and implementation.
