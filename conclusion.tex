\section{Conclusion}
In a system so complex, solutions must not only fit in, but also must provide \textit{value} to users and publishers alike.
Systems such as Harpocrates serve as thought experiments for re-imagining the Web such that both parties benefit.

This project was incredibly enlightening and thought-provoking.
In order to reason about the ecosystem at large, we were forced to go ``down the rabbit hole'' in order to understand how an ad is served.
In doing so, we gained an appreciation for the technology at use in making the internet as we know it free and accessible.
Furthermore, we got a better sense of just how dire the situation for publishers is, and our research contextualized why so many internet outlets are turning to ``click bait'' in order to boost traffic.
We hope that there is a better solution in which users directly compensate content producers.
