\section{Conclusion}
In such a high-stakes and complex marketplace as the internet, payment solutions must not only fit in, but also must provide \textit{value} to users and publishers alike.
Systems such as Harpocrates and the extensions we've presented here explore the concrete steps that we need to take in order to re-imagine the Web payment scheme in a way that better benefits both users and publishers.

Working on this project was very thought-provoking, and led us to see the Web in a whole new light.
In order to reason about the ecosystem at large and how a change to it could feasibly be made, we were forced to go ``down the rabbit hole'' in order to understand how ads are actually served in practice.
In doing so, we gained an appreciation for the technology at use in making the internet as we know it free and accessible, as well as a more complete understanding of an extremely important industry.
We also we got a better sense of just how dire the situation for publishers is, and our research contextualized why so many internet outlets are turning to ``click bait'' and other tactics in order to boost traffic.
Ultimately, all of the information that we've gathered learned here points to the fact that there are huge opportunities for innovation in both the research and commercial worlds surrounding internet micropayments, and we hope to see (and be a part of) substantial progress in solving this problem in the near future.
