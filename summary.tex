\section{Summary}
The modern ad ecosystem continues to grow and evolve at breakneck pace.
Although revenues continue to grow, so too does the adoption of ad-blockers, which in the limit threaten the viability of the current model for the internet.
Here, we describe a system which fits into the ad ecosystem without any specialized infrastructure or standards.
The system looks like an ad exchange to publishers, leading to low implementation costs and high scalability.
To the user, it looks like a regular browser extension.
Furthermore, it makes a feasible number of macropayments on a monthly basis to compensate publishers by users.
\textit{Un}acceptable Ads, two browser extensions which block ads or their requests probabilistically, allows users greater freedom in choosing to block the most obnoxious ads while still compensating publishers.
